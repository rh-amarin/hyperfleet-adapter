# HyperFleet Adapter Deployment Configuration
#
# This file contains ONLY infrastructure and deployment-related settings:
#   - Client connections (Maestro, HyperFleet API, Kubernetes)
#   - Authentication and TLS configuration
#   - Connection timeouts and retry policies
#
# NOTE: This is a SAMPLE configuration file for reference and local development.
# It is NOT automatically packaged with the container image (see Dockerfile).
#
# In production, provide configuration via one of these methods:
#   1. ADAPTER_CONFIG_PATH environment variable pointing to a config file (highest priority)
#   2. ConfigMap mounted at /etc/adapter/config/adapter-deployment-config.yaml
#
# Example Kubernetes deployment:
#   env:
#     - name: ADAPTER_CONFIG_PATH
#       value: /etc/adapter/config/adapter-deployment-config.yaml
#   volumeMounts:
#     - name: config
#       mountPath: /etc/adapter/config
#
# For business logic configuration (params, preconditions, resources, post-actions),
# use a separate business config file. See configs/adapter-config-template.yaml
