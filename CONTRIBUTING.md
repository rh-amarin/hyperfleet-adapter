## Code of Conduct

This project follows the [Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hyperfleet-adapter.git
   cd hyperfleet-adapter
   ```

3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/openshift-hyperfleet/hyperfleet-adapter.git
   ```

4. **Create a branch** for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b your-feature-branch
   ```

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.24 or later
- Docker (for building Docker images)
- `golangci-lint` (for linting)
- `make` (for running Makefile targets)

### Installing Dependencies

1. **Install Go dependencies**:
   ```bash
   make mod-tidy
   ```

2. **Install golangci-lint** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   go install github.com/golangci/golangci-lint/cmd/golangci-lint@latest
   ```

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build the binary
make build

# The binary will be created at: bin/hyperfleet-adapter
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
make test

# Run integration tests
make test-integration

# Run all tests
make test-all

# Run tests with coverage
make test-coverage
```

### Linting

```bash
# Run linter
make lint

# Format code
make fmt
```

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming

Use descriptive branch names that indicate the type of change:

- `feature/your-feature-name` - For new features
- `fix/your-fix-name` - For bug fixes
- `docs/your-doc-update` - For documentation changes
- `refactor/your-refactor-name` - For code refactoring

### Commit Messages

Follow these guidelines for commit messages:

1. **Use the present tense** ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
2. **Use the imperative mood** ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
3. **Limit the first line to 72 characters or less**
4. **Reference issues and pull requests** liberally after the first line
5. **Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji**:
   - 🎨 `:art:` - Improving structure / format of the code
   - 🐛 `:bug:` - Fixing a bug
   - 📝 `:memo:` - Writing docs
   - ✨ `:sparkles:` - Introducing new features
   - ♻️ `:recycle:` - Refactoring code
   - ✅ `:white_check_mark:` - Adding tests
   - 🔧 `:wrench:` - Changing configuration

Example:
```
✨ Add operation ID middleware for request tracing

- Implement OperationIDMiddleware to generate unique operation IDs
- Add GetOperationID and WithOpID helper functions
- Update logger to include operation ID in log context

Fixes #123
```

## Code Style

### Go Code Style

- Follow the [Effective Go](https://go.dev/doc/effective_go) guidelines
- Use `gofmt` or `goimports` to format code
- Run `make fmt` before committing

### General Guidelines

1. **Keep functions small and focused** - Each function should do one thing well
2. **Use meaningful variable names** - Avoid abbreviations unless they're widely understood
3. **Add comments** for exported functions, types, and packages
4. **Handle errors explicitly** - Don't ignore errors
5. **Use context.Context** for cancellation and timeouts in long-running operations

### Package Organization

- `cmd/` - Main applications for this project
- `pkg/` - Library code that can be imported by other projects
- `test/` - Integration tests and test utilities
- `data/` - Configuration templates and data files
- `charts/` - Helm chart templates

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Write unit tests for all new functionality
- Use table-driven tests when testing multiple scenarios
- Run tests before submitting: `make test`

### Integration Tests

- Write integration tests for components that interact with external systems
- Use testcontainers for testing with real dependencies (e.g., databases, message brokers)
- Run integration tests: `make test-integration`

### Test Guidelines

1. **Test names should be descriptive**: `TestFunctionName_Scenario_ExpectedBehavior`
2. **Use subtests** for multiple test cases:
   ```go
   func TestFunction(t *testing.T) {
       tests := []struct {
           name string
           // ... test cases
       }{
           // ... test data
       }
       
       for _, tt := range tests {
           t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
               // test implementation
           })
       }
   }
   ```
3. **Clean up resources** in tests (use `defer` or `t.Cleanup()`)

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

1. **Update your branch** with the latest changes from upstream:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run all checks**:
   ```bash
   make verify  # Runs lint and test
   ```

3. **Ensure all tests pass**:
   ```bash
   make test-all
   ```

4. **Check for linting errors**:
   ```bash
   make lint
   ```

5. **Format your code**:
   ```bash
   make fmt
   ```

### Pull Request Process

1. **Push your changes** to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin your-feature-branch
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request** on GitHub:
